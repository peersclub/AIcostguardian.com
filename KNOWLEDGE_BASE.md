- **Secondary**: SaaS Management Platform
- **Tertiary**: Business Intelligence Tool

## üí° Why Does This Product Exist?

### The Problem We Solve

#### 1. **The Hidden Cost Crisis**
- Companies are spending $10K-$1M+ monthly on AI without clear visibility
- Costs are scattered across multiple providers and departments
- No single source of truth for AI spending
- Surprise bills are common ("We spent HOW MUCH on GPT-4?!")

#### 2. **The Management Nightmare**
- Each provider has different billing systems
- API keys are shared without tracking
- No way to set limits or controls
- Different teams using different tools without coordination

#### 3. **The Optimization Challenge**
- Don't know which models are most cost-effective
- Can't compare providers easily
- No insights on usage patterns
- Missing opportunities to save 30-50% on AI costs

### Real-World Scenarios We Address

**Scenario 1: The Startup Shock**
> A startup integrates GPT-4 for customer support. Month 1: $500. Month 2: $5,000. Month 3: $50,000. They had no warning system, no usage limits, and no visibility until the bill arrived.

**Scenario 2: The Enterprise Sprawl**
> A Fortune 500 has 50 teams using AI. Marketing uses OpenAI, Engineering uses Claude, Data Science uses Gemini. Nobody knows the total spend, there's no unified billing, and API keys are everywhere.

**Scenario 3: The Developer Dilemma**
> A developer accidentally deploys a loop calling GPT-4. It runs all weekend, costing $30,000. There was no alert, no automatic shutoff, and no way to prevent it.
