## üìä Current Status

### Completed ‚úÖ
- Basic UI components
- Thread management UI
- Share dialog interface
- Collaboration presence UI
- Claude-like input interface
- Basic API endpoints

### In Progress üöß
- Database schema alignment
- API security
- Real-time infrastructure

### Not Started ‚ùå
- Testing
- Monitoring
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Production deployment

## üöÄ Recommended Launch Path

### Phase 1: MVP (2-3 weeks)
1. Fix critical security issues
2. Complete database migrations
3. Basic error handling
4. Simple WebSocket for collaboration
5. Connect core features (file upload, prompt analysis)
6. Basic testing (critical paths only)

### Phase 2: Beta (2-3 weeks)
1. Performance optimization
2. Comprehensive testing
3. Monitoring setup
4. Documentation
5. Limited user rollout
6. Gather feedback

### Phase 3: Production (1-2 weeks)
1. Scale infrastructure
2. Full security audit
3. Load testing
4. Disaster recovery plan
5. SLA establishment
6. Public launch

## üéØ Definition of "Production Ready"

The application is production-ready when:
1. **Security**: No known critical vulnerabilities
2. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime SLA achievable
3. **Performance**: <200ms response time (p95)
4. **Scalability**: Handles 1000+ concurrent users
5. **Testing**: >80% code coverage, all critical paths tested
6. **Monitoring**: Full observability stack deployed
7. **Documentation**: Complete API and user documentation
8. **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements
9. **Support**: On-call rotation established
10. **Recovery**: RTO < 1 hour, RPO < 5 minutes

## üìù Notes

- Current state: **Development/Prototype**
- Estimated time to production: **6-8 weeks** with full team
- Required team: 2-3 developers, 1 DevOps, 1 QA
- Estimated cost: Infrastructure ~$500-2000/month at scale

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- No real-time infrastructure
- Security vulnerabilities
- No testing coverage

### Medium Risk
- Performance under load
- Database scaling
- Error handling gaps

### Low Risk
- UI/UX polish
- Feature completeness
- Documentation
