## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES & WORKAROUNDS

### Issue 1: Slow AIOptimise Page Load
**Workaround**: Implement lazy loading
```javascript
const AIOptimise = dynamic(() => import('./aioptimise'), {
  loading: () => <LoadingSpinner />,
  ssr: false
})
```

### Issue 2: Redis Connection Timeout
**Workaround**: Use in-memory fallback
```javascript
if (!redis.isConnected) {
  useInMemoryCache()
}
```

### Issue 3: Email Delivery Delays
**Workaround**: Queue emails and retry
```javascript
await emailQueue.add('send-email', data, {
  attempts: 3,
  backoff: { type: 'exponential' }
})
```
