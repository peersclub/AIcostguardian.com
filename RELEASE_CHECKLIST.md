## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Environment Variables
```bash
# Generate secrets
openssl rand -base64 32  # For NEXTAUTH_SECRET
openssl rand -hex 32     # For ENCRYPTION_KEY
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Option A: CLI
vercel --prod

# Option B: GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 3. Post-Deployment
1. Run database migrations
2. Seed initial data
3. Update OAuth redirect URLs
4. Test authentication flow

## 🧪 E2E Testing Results

### ✅ Core Functionality
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Homepage | ✅ Working | Loads correctly |
| Health API | ✅ Working | Returns status (unhealthy without DB is expected) |
| Auth Pages | ✅ Working | Sign-in page accessible |
| Rate Limiting | ✅ Working | Falls back to in-memory when Redis not configured |
| Error Handling | ✅ Working | Error boundaries implemented |

### ⚠️ Known Issues (Non-Critical)
1. **Database Connection Warnings**: Expected during build without production DB
2. **Redis Warnings**: Falls back to in-memory rate limiting
3. **Sentry Warnings**: Instrumentation warnings - safe to ignore
